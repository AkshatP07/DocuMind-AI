# DocuMind-AI

Welcome to **DocuMind-AI**, a hackathon-born project designed to revolutionize the way you interact with your personal document library. No more losing your place or struggling to connect ideas across files—pick up exactly where you left off with a seamless, intelligent reading experience. This repository can also serve as a fallback if you’re not using the Docker image.

***imp : the keys need to be hardcoded in certain files for the app to run***
Those files are:
- client/src/components/RightSideBar.jsx (gemini api key)
- client/src/components/AdobePdfViewer.jsx (client id adobe) - can be generated from https://acrobatservices.adobe.com/dc-integration-creation-app-cdn/main.html?api=pdf-embed-api ***keep Application Domain as localhost***
- server/routers/tts.py (azure key&region and gemini api key)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Backend Setup
The backend is built with Python and FastAPI. Using a virtual environment is recommended.

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell
   # OR
   source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux 
2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd server
2. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. **Run the backend server with uvicorn:**
Uvicorn is a high-performance server that's great for running FastAPI applications, which is what the backend uses.
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080

### Frontend Setup
The frontend is a React application created with Vite. We're using Tailwind CSS for a modern, utility-first styling approach.

1. **Initialize the React app with Vite (if not already done):**
   Follow the prompts to choose react as your framework.
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
3. **Install Tailwind CSS:**
   Follow the official Tailwind CSS documentation for installation with Vite: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite.
4. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client
2. **Install the necessary dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
2. **Run the development server::**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
